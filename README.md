## About

I am making a website for a friend's banquet hall \
I'll have to design and develop the whole website alone \
it's a good opportunity to work my skills on a real "professional" project \
( all my past projects were for Aptech E-Projects or assignments ) \
I'll be documenting my progress here on github.&nbsp;&nbsp; ( ^\_^ )
